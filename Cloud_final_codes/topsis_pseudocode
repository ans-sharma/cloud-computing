Algorithm TOPSIS
Input: Student Information ranking criteria values x,
    Weight of each criterion w,
Output: Best T
//T is the best tradeoff solution

Create a decision matrix D
//Calculate normalized decision matrix
FOR X, in D do
    Calculate ny
ENDFOR

/ /Calculate normalized weighted decision matrix
FOR My in D do
    Calculate Vy = wing
ENDFOR

//Determine the positive and negative ideal solutions
FOR V, in D do
    Calculate S and S
ENDFOR

//Calculate separations from S" and S
FOR Vy in D do
    Calculate d, and d,
ENDFOR

//Determine R,
FOR Vy in D do
    Calculate R,
ENDFOR
//Rank the solutions and return solution with maximum R
